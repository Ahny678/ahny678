## Hi there 👋

I’m **Tiffany** (though I prefer **Ahny**).

I’m a **Backend Developer** with experience in **Node.js**, **NestJS**, and **Django**. I’ve also explored the field of **AI**, working on projects in **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**.

* 🚀 I am **currently learning** the **React** framework to better showcase my Node.js/NestJS backend projects.
* 💼 I am **working on** a private project under the [RiseVest](https://risevest.com/) organization.
* 🛠️ I recently **built** a **Smart Job Matching API** powered by **GPT-4.1**, BullMQ, and RapidAPI — [check it out here](https://github.com/Ahny678/IntelliScout).
* 🤝 I'm **looking to collaborate** on **Full-Stack projects** as a backend developer. I’m experienced in OpenAPI Swagger documentation — [see a demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aTOhHzKJng) of my E-Diary [API project](https://github.com/Ahny678/E-Chronicles).
